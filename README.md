### Init behavior

The behavior of the *init* command varies from service to service. This behavior must be adjusted in *ctl.sh* depending on the service. Otherwise, an error message appears when executing the init command. The use case for initializing is to create the volumes and copy configuration files from etc into them so that they can be edited afterwards.

## Service configuration values that need to be adjusted 
After executing the *init* command, the configuration files must be adjusted in most cases. This should only happen in the volumes folder and not in the etc folder. Otherwise, sensitive data may be pushed upstream.  
The following table gives an overview of which files must be adjusted.

| Value   | File    |
| ------- | ------- |
| EXAMPLE | EXAMPLE |

## Versioning of services and domain name settings
The versioning of the services as well as the domain name settings are done via an *.env* file which is automatically read by docker-compose. For this, the *env.example* should be copied and adapted. It should be noted that no secrets should end up in the *.env*.

## Secrets
Secrets should be created in a file that contains only the secrets for the corresponding service
and grouped in the *secrets* folder. An example for this is *service.secrets.example*. Please note that the file permissions should be as restrictive as possible.
